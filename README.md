### Install UUID
UUID stands for Universally Unique IDentifier, which literally means 'universally unique identifier'. As such, the UUID is a standard identifier code used in the software building process. It is used to create universal unique identifiers that allow recognizing and distinguishing an object within a system, or the same object in different contexts.

```

### Install nodemon
nodemon is a tool that helps develop Node.js based applications by automatically restarting the node application when file changes in the directory are detected.

Either through cloning with git or by using npm (the recommended way):

```
$ npm install -g nodemon
```
And nodemon will be installed globally to your system path.

You can also install nodemon as a development dependency:

```
$ npm install --save-dev nodemon
```
